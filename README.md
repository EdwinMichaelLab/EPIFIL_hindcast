This repository contains the scripts required to fit the lymphatic 
filariasis transmission model, EPIFIL, to site-specific conditions as it
pertains to the manuscript:

Basic workflow:

1. Define details of baseline transmission conditions and intervention 
details to simulate. These details can either be based on observed data or 
proposed scenarios. Details should be defined in "IO/baseline_data.m" and 
"IO/Intv_data.m". Following the data entry, make the corresponding edits to
"IO/setup_Vars.m" and run this script. This script will generate required
input files for running the simulations, which will be saved and accessed 
by other functions in "IO/IN".

2. First the model must be calibrated to the baseline conditions defined in 
the previous step. To do this, run the file 
"BaselineFitting/Main_ToRunBaselineFitting.m". This will select a set of
best-fitting parameter vectors that reproduce the defined baseline conditions
for use in subsequent simulations. The parameter vectors, along with baseline
estimates of age-stratified infection prevalence and other key output variables,
will be saved in a .mat file (one for each site modeled) 
called "IO/OUT/ParamVectors{SiteName}.mat". These files will be accessed by
other functions in Hindcasting and Interventions.

3. If no baseline data is available for a given site, the above baseline
fitting procedure will have been completed using plausible restrictions on 
the baseline transmission conditions. The resulting parameter vectors can
be further refined by fitting to observed data during the intervention period. 
By running the file "Hindcasting/Main_ToRunHindcasting.m", the originally 
constrained parameter vectors will be further constrained by first simulating
the observed interventions and then fitting to the observed data at a given
point in time beyond the baseline year. The new parameter vectors, along with
other key output variables, will be saved in a .mat file (one for each site 
modeled) called "IO/OUT/Hindcast{SiteName}.mat". The outputs stored here can
be used in further analyses and will be accessed by
other functions in Interventions.

4. To simulate interventions over time using the parameter vectors selected,
by the BaselineFitting or Hindcasting procedures above, run the file
"Interventions/Main_ToRunIntv.m". Check that the correct output file is being
loaded in line 119 - either "IO/OUT/ParamVectors{SiteName}.mat" or 
"IO/OUT/Hindcast{SiteName}.mat" depending on which set of parameters are 
needed. Results of the intervention simulation will be saved in a .mat file 
one for each site modeled) called "IO/OUT/Intv{SiteName}.mat". The outputs 
stored here can be used in further analyses.
